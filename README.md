From fun to finance, from science to security, from prediction to protein, the expanse of machine learning algorithms has reached every stratum. Humans are vulnerable and are open to over or under estimation, but not machines. For providing appropriate results and making effective decisions on data, some advanced data mining techniques can be used in many fields. Healthcare is an inevitable task to be done in human life. In today's era the leading cause of death is Heart Disease. Machine Learning plays a crucial role in predicting the presence or absence of Heart Disease by assisting the doctors to treat heart patients efficiently. We proposed a machine-learning-based diagnosis system for heart disease prediction by using heart disease dataset. <br/><br/>
This project proposes a prediction model to predict whether people have a heart disease or not and to provide an awareness or diagnosis on that. This is done by comparing the accuracies of applying rules to the individual results of Support Vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor classifier (K-NN), SVM with PCA and K-NN with PCA on the dataset taken in a region to present an accurate model of predicting cardiovascular disease. The dataset contains nearly 13 medical parameters which are considered important during the prediction of heart disease. The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart diseases.<br/><br/>
